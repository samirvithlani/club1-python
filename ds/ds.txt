list vs set
list is ordered and set is unordered
list is mutable and set is mutable
list is hashable and set is not hashable
list is subscriptable and set is not subscriptable list[0]
list is sliceable and set is not sliceable
list is iterable and set is iterable
list is indexable and set is not indexable
list Allows duplicate members and set does not allow duplicate members
list or set which is faster? and why?

generally the list are faster...
but in case of searching set is faster beacuse it is hashable
